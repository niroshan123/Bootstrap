      <p class="text-left text-lowercase">The word essay derives from the French infinitive essayer.</p>
      <p class="text-center text-uppercase">p "to try" or "to attempt".</p>     <p class="text-right">p "to try" or "to attempt".</p>    In English essay first meant "a trial" or "an attempt", 
       <p class="text-justify text-capitalize"> and this is still an alternative meaning. The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne (1533â€“1592) 
        was the first author to describe his work as essays; 
        he used the term to characterize these as "attempts" to put his thoughts into writing.
        Subsequently, essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a "prose
         composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse".[2]
          It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. Aldous Huxley, a leading essayist, 
          gives guidance on the subject. xxxe notes that "the essay is a literary device for saying
           almost everything about almost anything", </p>
